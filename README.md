# Backend LAB

Welcome to the "Backend LAB" repository! This is where I'll be working on a series of projects to learn and improve my skills in Backend development. The repository is organized in a way that allows me to experiment with various aspects of Backend technology, and it will be structured using **workspaces** to keep things modular and focused.

This project follows the Backend development roadmap from [https://roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh).

## Learning Goals

In this repository, I will cover key Backend concepts, including:

- Server-side languages (Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Databases (SQL and NoSQL)
- API development (REST, GraphQL)
- Authentication & Authorization
- Backend architectures (MVC, microservices, etc.)

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into different workspaces, each representing a separate project or topic. As I progress through my learning journey, I will add more projects.

### Workspaces Explained

The repository uses a workspace structure defined in the `package.json` file under the `"workspaces"` key. Each workspace is located in the `projects/*` directory. This setup allows for modular development, where each project can be developed and managed independently. 

For example:
- **projects/api-server**: Contains the code and dependencies for the API server project.
- **projects/auth-service**: Contains the code and dependencies for the authentication service project.

This structure helps in maintaining a clean and organized codebase, making it easier to manage dependencies and work on multiple projects simultaneously.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or suggest any improvements to the projects!
